# 0x02. React Props

## Overview

This project focuses on mastering the use of props in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By the end of this project, you should be able to create and reuse React components, pass properties (props) to components, define types for components, and utilize React Fragments effectively. Additionally, you'll learn when to use a key to improve the performance of list rendering.

## Learning Objectives

- **Create Basic React Components**: Understand how to define components using functions in React.
- **Reuse Components**: Learn best practices for reusing components across your application to enhance maintainability and reduce redundancy.
- **Pass Properties (Props) to Components**: Master the technique of passing data to child components via props, enabling more dynamic and flexible components.
- **Define Types for Components**: Utilize tools like PropTypes or TypeScript to define and enforce types for component props, improving code quality and reducing bugs.
- **Use Fragments**: Implement React Fragments to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
- **Use Keys in Lists**: Understand the importance of keys in lists for efficient rendering and how they help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Node.js Version**: 12.x.x
- **NPM Version**: 6.x.x
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- **Project Structure**: Ensure all files end with a new line. A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.

## Resources

- [React Official Website](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Getting Started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [React Developer Tools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/09/02/new-react-developer-tools.html)

- [React Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)

## Project Instructions

1. **Create Components**: Begin by creating simple functional components. Understand the basics of component structure and lifecycle.
2. **Pass Props**: Experiment with passing different types of props to components and accessing them within the component.
3. **Reuse Components**: Implement a component that can be reused in different parts of the application. Ensure it is flexible and configurable through props.
4. **Type Checking with PropTypes**: Introduce PropTypes to your components to enforce type checking and prop validation.
5. **Using Fragments**: Replace unnecessary wrapper elements with React Fragments where applicable.
6. **Keys in Lists**: Create a list of items using a map function and assign a unique key to each item for optimal rendering performance.

## Manual QA Review

Once you've completed the project, request a manual QA review to ensure all requirements are met and your implementation is robust and error-free.
